[1] ``<ARRAY>.LENGTH`` SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UP IN EVERY LOOP OF A`` FOR``-LOOP

The overheads outlined below are *PER LOOP*, excluding the first loop

-storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (100 gas)
-memory arrays use MLOAD (3 gas)
-calldata arrays use CALLDATALOAD (3 gas)
Caching the length changes each of these to a DUP<N> (3 gas), and gets rid of the extra DUP<N> needed to store the stack offset.

[2]  USAGE OF ``UINTS/INTS`` SMALLER THAN 32 BYTES (256 BITS) INCURS OVERHEAD

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

[3] FUNCTIONS GUARANTEED TO REVERT WHEN CALLED BY NORMAL USERS CAN BE MARKED ``PAYABLE``

If a function modifier such as ``onlyOwner`` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as ``payable`` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are ``CALLVALUE``(2),``DUP1``(3),``ISZERO``(3),``PUSH``2(3),``JUMPI``(10),``PUSH1``(3),``DUP1``(3),``REVERT``(0),``JUMPDEST``(1),``POP``(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost
