## Recommend
event is missing indexed fields in important parameter. we recommend indexed at important field for increase creadibility.

## Recommendation
In the contracts, floating pragmas should not be used. Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.
We suggest to recheck your file and update the pragma.

## [L-01] Missing zero address for constructor
## Code Snipped
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/e3b2c053f722b0ca2dce3a3eb06f64859b8b7a6f/contracts/ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator.sol#L21

## Recommendation
Checking addresses against zero-address during initialization in constructor is a security best-practice. However, such checks are missing in multiple constructors.  Allowing zero-addresses will lead to contract reverts and force redeployments if there are no setters for such address variables. So we recommend to Add zero-address checks in the constructors.

## [L-02] Missing check zero address

## recommendation
to avoid zero address in parameter input. we suggest to add zero check address to the function.

## [L-03] Logical fault: improper receive function
## code snipped

## recommendation
The Portal contract is able to receive native assets, however, no function exists in the contract that utilizes funds received as an argument.
We advise the function to be omitted from the contract to avoid locked native assets.
