QA1. Lock the most recent version of solidity 0.8.17consistently (currrently, some use 0.8.14, some use 0.8.17).

QA2.

There is no need to implement the function ``_executeAtomicOrders`` separately, instead one can easily add a revert statement into the ``catch{}`` part in ``_executeNonAtomicOrders`` to support the atomic case, in which we need to revert the whole transaction when the execution of one order fails as follows:
```
try{
}
catch{
     if(isAtomic) revert ExecuteAtomicOrdersFailure();
}

```
This will save much audit effort and code duplication. As a result, the fucntion ``_handleFees`` can be eliminated as well.

QA3: Simply the function ``_executeSingleOrder()`` as follows
```
  function _executeSingleOrder(
        OrderTypes.TakerOrder memory takerBid,
        OrderTypes.MakerOrder memory makerAsk,
        address recipient,
        CollectionType collectionType,
        bool isAtomic
    ) private
 {
            try marketplace.matchAskWithTakerBidUsingETHAndWETH{value: takerBid.price}(takerBid, makerAsk) {
                _transferTokenToRecipient(
                    collectionType,
                    recipient,
                    makerAsk.collection,
                    makerAsk.tokenId,
                    makerAsk.amount
                );
            } catch {
                  if(isAtomic) revert ExecuteSingleOrderFailure();
            }
}
```

It will be helpful to make the contract pausible in case the owner of the ``LooksRareAggregator`` contract is compromised.
