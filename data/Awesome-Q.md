## The lines are too long

Usually, lines in source code are limited to 80 characters. Todayâ€™s screens are much larger so itâ€™s reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over 164 characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length

## Typos

Consider sticking to the proper spelling of words otherwise, it will decrease readability

Change "as set of" to "a set of"

## `block.timestamp` is unreliable

Using `block.timestamp` as part of the time checks could be slightly modified by miners/validators to favor them in contracts that contain logic heavily dependent on them.

Consider this problem and warn users that a scenario like this could occur. If the change of timestamps will not affect the protocol in any way, consider documenting the reasoning and writing tests enforcing that these guarantees will be preserved even if the code changes in the future.

## Unspecific Compiler Version Pragma

Avoid floating pragmas for non-library contracts.

While floating pragmas make sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of applications, it may be a security risk for application implementations.

A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up checking a different EVM compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

It is recommended to pin to a concrete compiler version.

For example:
ðŸ¤¦ Bad:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

ðŸš€ Good:

```
pragma solidity 0.8.4;
```
