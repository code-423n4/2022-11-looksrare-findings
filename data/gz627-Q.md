## OwnershipTransfer does not check address(0)
Affected Code: [OwnableTwoSteps.sol#L99-L102](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/OwnableTwoSteps.sol#L99-L102)

When initiating an ownership transfer, the contract does not check if the potential new owner is mistakenly set to address(0). This may prevent the ownership transfer from completion. Although the ownership transfer can then be cancelled, it's better to prevent it from happening.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add `require(newPotentialOwner != address(0))` to the beginning of the function `initiateOwnershipTransfer()`.
